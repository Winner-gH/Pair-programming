![presentation](/assets/image.png)

## This repo is where the final pull request is to be made after the completion of the whole pair programming task.

Firstly let's understand what is the task that is to be completed and put into the file. Let's say that your first name is X-Mas, now 
- Your first initial is X.
- A-->1    B-->2   C-->3   D-->4
- Similarly Z-->26
- Calculate the count of your first name's first initial, which in our case is 'X' which corresponds to 24.
- Now you have to perform the obtained number's integer division by 2.
- In our case it is 12.
- Finally you have to write your first name followed by hyphen and then the answer obtained.
- In our case it will be X-Mas-12
- If this answer comes out to be 0 then add 1 to it.

### Kindly note that only first-year students are permitted to do the tasks using the GitHub UI; second-year students may complete tasks using the UI wherever necessary, otherwise using the command line.

## Main Task 
- 1st person (let's say X) creates a repository in his Github account.
- X now creates a branch in the newly created repository.
- X now creates a text file (.txt) in the branch and then completes the task mentioned earlier.
- The 2nd person (let's say Y) now forks X's repository and then clones it to his local directory.
- Y now switches to the branch created by X.
- Y now edits the same file created by X and in the next line completes the same task mentioned earlier with his first name.
- Y adds, commits and pushes the changes to his remote repository.
- Y now creates a pull request for the same.
- X now merges Y's pull request.
- Finally either one of X or Y make a pull request to this repository by adding their Name and the URL of X's repository in the text file named TaskCompleted.txt
