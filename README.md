![presentation](/assets/image.png)

## This repo is where the final pull request is to be made after the completion of the whole pair programming task mentioned below.

Firstly let's understand what is the task that is to be completed and put into the file. Let's say that your first name is Yash, now 
- Your first initial is Y.
- A-->1    B-->2   C-->3   D-->4
- Similarly Z-->26
- Calculate the count of your first name's first initial, which in our case is 'Y' which corresponds to 25.
- Finally you have to write your first name's first initial followed by hyphen and then the answer.
- In our case it will be Y-25


## Main Task 
- 1st person (let's say X) creates a repository in his Github account.
- X now creates a text file (.txt) and then completes the task mentioned earlier.
- The 2nd person (let's say Y) now forks X's repository and then clones it to his local directory.
- Y now edits the same file created by X and in the next line completes the same task mentioned earlier with his first name.
- Y adds, commits and pushes the changes to his remote repository.
- Y now creates a pull request for the same.
- X now merges Y's pull request.
- Finally either one of X or Y should make a pull request to this repository by adding their Name and the URL of X's repository in the text file named TaskCompleted.txt above.
